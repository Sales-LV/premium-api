{"name":"Premium API","tagline":"Client API for Premium from Sales.lv","body":"premium-api\r\n===========\r\n\r\nClient API for Sales.lv **[Premium](http://www.sales.lv/lv/risinajumi/premium/)** service. In its essence **Premium** is a platform for\r\nimplementing services based on mobile-originated (incoming from users) SMS processing. In practice there is a number of applications\r\nbuilt upon this platform, for example, user message processing, SMS micropayment handling, lotteries, etc. (Lotteries are a special case\r\nas there is a lot of lottery-specific functionality implemented in Premium that goes above and beyond SMS processing).\r\n\r\nThis is a simple HTTP API where data is requested or manipulated with HTTP requests. We are also providing client libraries\r\n(currently only in PHP) to make work easier.\r\n\r\nThere is a specification provided in the [wiki here](https://github.com/Sales-LV/premium-api/wiki) about making the API calls yourself,\r\nas well as examples of using our libraries\r\n\r\nA quick start guide\r\n------------\r\n- Sign up for the [Premium service with Sales.lv](http://www.sales.lv/lv/risinajumi/premium/).
